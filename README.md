The **Auth Service** is an essential component of any application that manages user authentication and authorization. It handles user registration, login, and access token generation using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The service ensures secure access to protected routes by validating tokens and supports role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain resources based on user roles. Additionally, it includes token refresh mechanisms for session management and can optionally integrate with third-party OAuth providers like Google or Facebook for seamless login experiences. This service is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to integrate with other parts of your application.
